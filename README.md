# Todo App

This is a simple Todo App built with React. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and filtering tasks based on their status. The app also provides the ability to store the tasks locally, so the progress is preserved even after refreshing the page.

### Features

- Add a new task: Users can enter task details and add them to the list.

- Complete a task: Users can mark a task as complete by clicking on the checkbox.

- Filter tasks: Users can toggle between "All," "Active," and "Completed" tabs to view tasks based on their status.

- Remove tasks: Under the "Completed" tab, users can remove individual tasks by clicking on the delete icon or remove all completed tasks at once.

### Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React Icons: A library that provides a collection of popular icons as React components.
